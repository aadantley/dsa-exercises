# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository has solutions to problems from the book `A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms` by Jay Wengrow.

These solutions I wrote personally, and added comments to specify updates where my initial solution needed updating.

All solutions implemented in python currently.

## To Dos

- [ ] implement solutions in JavaScript.
